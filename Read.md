Product Recommendation Engine
This repository contains a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system built on Apache Spark using the Amazon Product Reviews Dataset. The project is designed to provide personalized product recommendations using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and optimized for large-scale data with Delta Lake.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This engine is developed as an individual project to build a scalable and efficient recommendation system leveraging real-world customer review data from Amazon.

ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Customers often struggle to find relevant products due to the overwhelming variety. This recommendation engine aims to:
Suggest relevant products using collaborative filtering.
Process millions of reviews efficiently.
Handle real-time or incremental updates.
Improve accuracy through model optimization.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arhamrumi/amazon-product-reviews]
Name: Amazon Product Reviews Dataset
Fields:
ProductID
UserID
Rating
ReviewText
Timestamp

ðŸš€ Project Objectives
Clean and preprocess large-scale review data.
Build a user-item interaction matrix.
Implement and optimize the ALS collaborative filtering model.
Enable scalable training and inference using Spark and Delta Lake.
Measure performance improvements with RMSE and data optimization techniques.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

ðŸ“Š Pipeline Tasks

1. Data Preprocessing
Convert and clean timestamps
Remove null and irrelevant columns
Deduplicate data

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Identify top reviewers, trending products, and review distributions
Understand product and user-level engagement

3. ALS Model Building
Build user-item matrix
Train initial ALS model
Evaluate with RMSE

4. Optimization
Hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation
Use Delta Lake for incremental updates
Apply Z-Ordering and Vacuum for performance

5. Final Model
Achieved RMSE: 0.26
